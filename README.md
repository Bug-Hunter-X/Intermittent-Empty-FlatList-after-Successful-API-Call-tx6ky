# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently fails to render data after a successful API call. The API call is confirmed to be successful, returning a valid JSON response, yet the FlatList remains empty.  This behavior is inconsistent and challenging to debug.

## Problem Description

The `DataFetch` component makes a fetch request to a public API to retrieve user data.  While the API request is successful and returns data, the FlatList component often fails to display this data, showing an empty list instead.  No errors are thrown during the API call or the rendering process. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application using `npx react-native run-android` (or the equivalent for iOS).
3. Observe the FlatList's behavior.  You may need to run the app several times to reproduce the issue (intermittent).

## Potential Causes

Investigating this involved checking for issues with the data format returned by the API and the FlatList's configuration.  The issue is not related to API response format or component configuration, but rather an intermittent rendering problem.
